Did not do the extra credit
The tests work, but most are slightly less accurate than they should have been.  I have not found out why.
I encountered an issue several times where, on trying to change how the program worked, the tests for a single type (even ones like bimodal, where there are multiple tests within the type) would consistantly have the same result, which made no sense.
The program is also very slow, due to the constant allocation of memory due to the Nodes I use. I spent hours trying to fix this; I did not fix it.
The program prints as it goes, but only to assure you it is still functioning.
